# grunt-init-sails-requirejs

A grunt init template that initializes a sails.js project with foundation, requirejs, and SASS pre-configured. Grunt tasks has been streamlined to eliminate unused components and optimize public asset generation.

A rudimentary user, and session controller have also been included to allow for authenticated sessions out of the box.

TODO

 - [ ] Add messaging to the build output reminding the user to `npm install && bower install`
